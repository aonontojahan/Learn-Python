'''Define a function that takes three integers as input representing the coefficients of a quadratic equation.
Return the roots of the quadratic equation.
Hint: The quadratic formula is x = [-b Â± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a).
The term inside the square root, b^2 - 4ac, is called the discriminant.
If it's positive, there are two real roots.
If it's zero, there's one real root.
If it's negative, there are two complex roots'''
